## Learning Outcomes
* Describe the signal characteristics of speech and audio signals using
appropriate terminology
  * Understand the importance of simulating degradations.
* Apply signal processing algorithms to speech and audio signals
  * Gain knowledge of clipping distortion and simulate clipping from scratch using Python.
  * Gain knowledge of convolution and impulse response, covering both theory and practical application through Python coding.
  * Understand background noise and SNR concepts.
* Create programmes to conduct experiments on speech and audio samples building on third software libraries
  * Simulate a voice call by sequentially applying degradations and reflecting on the order of degradation.

## Module Topics
Advanced topics Speech and Audio Quality

*   Speech and Audio Quality
*   Objective models of intelligibility and quality

## Why is it important?
* Objective Quality Evaluation:

  * Assessing speech quality in diverse conditions (background noise, packet loss, distortion).
  * Generating artificial degradations facilitates testing quality metrics in realistic scenarios.

* Speech Enhancement and Separation Algorithms:
  * Artificial degradations enable testing these algorithms in diverse real-world conditions.

* Deep Learning:
  * Creating large training datasets with various degradations reduces bias and enhances model generalization.
  * Data augmentation, involving modified speech signal copies, improves performance, especially with limited datasets.

## Structure of this tutorial
This practical tutorial contains different sections:
* **Live coding:** Basic theory, demos and coding examples presented by the lecturer on site (unmarked)
* **Student activity:** Familiarisation and coding exercises to be completed by the students and followed by a short discussion on site (unmarked). These activities introduce key concepts and skills necessary to complete the assignments.
* **Assignment:** Two (2) take home problem/coding questions to be completed by the students by (see Unit 2 brightspace). Assignment questions represent fifteen (15) mark points.
